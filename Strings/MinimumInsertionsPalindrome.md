**Problem Statement :**
Minimum insertions to form a palindrome with permutations allowed. 

The problem of finding the minimum number of insertions to form a palindrome when permutations of the input string are allowed is a fascinating exercise in string manipulation and understanding palindromes. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, such as "radar" or "level". When permutations are allowed, you can rearrange the characters of the string before adding characters to form a palindrome.

**Key Insights**

**1. Palindrome Characteristics**: For a string to be a palindrome, each character must appear an even number of times, except for at most one character, which can appear an odd number of times (and would be placed in the middle of the palindrome).

**2. Count Character Frequencies**: The first step is to count the frequency of each character in the input string.

**3. Determine the Minimum Insertions**: The minimum number of insertions required to form a palindrome is related to the number of characters that have an odd count:

1. If all characters appear an even number of times, or if only one character appears an odd number of times, no insertions are needed.
2. If more than one character appears an odd number of times, insertions are needed to make all but one of those characters appear an even number of times.

**Problem Statement**
Given a string s, find the minimum number of insertions needed to make a palindrome. Permutations of the string are allowed before inserting characters.

**Approach**
Count the Frequencies: Iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character.

**Analyze Frequencies**: Determine how many characters appear an odd number of times.

**Calculate Insertions**: The minimum number of insertions needed is equal to the number of characters with odd occurrences minus 1 (since one odd-count character is allowed in a palindrome). If all characters occur an even number of times, or there is exactly one character with an odd count, no insertions are required.

**Example**
Input: s = "moom"

The frequency count is: {'m': 2, 'o': 2}.
All characters occur an even number of times.
Minimum Insertions: 0.
Input: s = "leetcode"

The frequency count might be: {'l': 1, 'e': 3, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'd': 1}.
Six characters occur an odd number of times.
Minimum Insertions: 6 - 1 = 5.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
   public static int minInsertionsToFormPalindrome(String s) {
      Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
      for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
         frequencyMap.put(c, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
      }

      int oddCount = 0;
      for (int count : frequencyMap.values()) {
         if (count % 2 == 1) oddCount++;
      }

      return Math.max(0, oddCount - 1);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      String s1 = "moom";
      System.out.println(minInsertionsToFormPalindrome(s1)); // Output: 0

      String s2 = "leetcode";
      System.out.println(minInsertionsToFormPalindrome(s2)); // Output: 5
   }
}


```
